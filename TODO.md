Not done:

- Boot receiver don't work
- Notification scheduling
- Receiver/Service should update boot count
- UI is not reactive (currently should restart app to see updates)
- Dismissal logic
- Storage in activity is not good (no time for doing MVI/MVVM)

I tried my best to make something in that time :)
